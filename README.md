# NYU-Bootcamp-Bonus
# Hotdog Detector (Streamlit + Pretrained ResNet50)

This app uses a pretrained ResNet50 model from `torchvision.models` to classify whether an uploaded image is a **hotdog** or **not hotdog**, inspired by the Silicon Valley sketch.

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
